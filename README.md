# Notes Rob
Ionic commands should be run from the src folder, rest from the root folder.

# run locally in lab mode
ionic serve --lab

# build for ios
ionic cordova build ios --prod


### Credits
I've used the template project from https://github.com/paulsutherland/Polyonic.git


# Running Live Reload for Electron Development
When developing a desktop app, you will want to have the app live reload as you save your changes.  
```
npm run dev
```
# Ionic CLI Commands
When developing a web app, progressive app or native mobile app, all of the Ionic CLI commands are available when you are in the src directory, as this is a standard Ionic app.  Change into the src directory and run commands from the Ionic CLI.  
```
cd src
ionic

eg:
ionic serve --lab --port 4000 -r
```
